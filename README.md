# learning-time

## Katas
Writing similar apps and code across multiple languages helps me understand
their various strengths & weaknesses, and allows me to stretch beyond my comfort
zone in an attempt to write real [Ruby|JS|Elixir|etc.], rather than just carry
my usual OO/Ruby style into other languages. Here's the sorts of things I
[am|will|have] writ[ing|e|ten].
* Tic tac toe
* A simple web server
* A sudoku solver
* A fractal generator, e.g. the [Mandelbrot
  set](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandelbrot_set)

Also, pretty much any of the [CodeKata](http://codekata.com/) examples or
[Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/archives).


## Languages
I know a few, and am learning more. Here's some I'm playing with (or have), and my self-estimated competency level (1=written 'hello world', know the basic types/data structures/syntax; 5=could comfortably program in it professionally, but still referencing docs for some of the more obscure functions; 8=a true expert, comfortable talking about the language, how it works underneath the hood, the ecosystem, how popular libraries work, etc; 10=I wrote this language):
* Ruby (7/10)
* JavaScript (6/10)
* Python (3/10)
* Elixir (1/10)
* Clojure (0.5/10)
* Go (0/10)
* C (0/10)
* Rust (0/10)
