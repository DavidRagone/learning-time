## Katas
Writing similar apps and code across multiple languages helps me understand
their various strengths & weaknesses, and allows me to stretch beyond my comfort
zone in an attempt to write real [Ruby|JS|Elixir|etc.], rather than just carry
my usual OO/Ruby style into other languages. Here's the sorts of things I
[am|will|have] writ[ing|e|ten].
* A todo app
* A test framework
* Tic tac toe
* A simple web server
* A sudoku solver
* A fractal generator, e.g. the [Mandelbrot
  set](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandelbrot_set)

Also, pretty much any of the [CodeKata](http://codekata.com/) examples or
[Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/archives) examples, or (if I really want to go deep), any of the suggestions [that every cs majors should do](http://matt.might.net/articles/what-cs-majors-should-know/)


## Languages
I know a few, and am learning more. Here's some I'm playing with (or have), and my self-estimated competency level (1=written 'hello world', know the basic types/data structures/syntax; 5=could comfortably program in it professionally, but still referencing docs for some of the more obscure functions; 8=a true expert, comfortable talking about the language, how it works underneath the hood, the ecosystem, how popular libraries work, etc; 10=I wrote this language):
* Ruby (7.5/10)
* JavaScript (5/10)
* Python (2/10)
* Elixir (0/10)
* Clojure (0/10)
* Go (0/10)
* C (0/10)
* Rust (0/10)
* Crystal (0/10)

## Frameworks / Libraries / Tools
* JavaScript
  * [VueJS](http://vuejs.org/) (0/10)
  * React (1/10)
* Elixir
  * [Phoenix](http://www.phoenixframework.org/) (0/10)


## Expertise
Over time, I imagine I'll go deep in some areas, but hope to have a great variety of areas in which I have some knowledge and experience. I'm not 100% sure which of these areas I will dive deep on, so for now am continuing to go wide (mostly working off of [Google's recommendations](https://www.google.com/about/careers/students/guide-to-technical-development.html)):
* Object-oriented programming
* Functional programming
* Web development
* UX Design
* AI / Machine Learning
* Building compilers
* Cryptography
