## Katas
Writing similar apps and code across multiple languages helps me understand
their various strengths & weaknesses, and allows me to stretch beyond my comfort
zone in an attempt to write real [Ruby|JS|Elixir|etc.], rather than just carry
my usual OO/Ruby style into other languages. Here's the sorts of things I
[am|will|have] writ[ing|e|ten].
* Tic tac toe
* A simple web server
* A sudoku solver
* A fractal generator, e.g. the [Mandelbrot
  set](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandelbrot_set)

Also, pretty much any of the [CodeKata](http://codekata.com/) examples or
[Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/archives).


## Languages
I know a few, and am learning more. Here's some I'm playing with (or have)
* Ruby
* JavaScript
* Python
* Elixir
* Clojure
* C
