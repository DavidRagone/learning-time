#### [JavaScript: Arrow Functions for Beginners](https://hackernoon.com/javascript-arrow-functions-for-beginners-926947fc0cdc)

```javascript
// Arrow functions look like:
(parameters) => { statements }
// Opening parens are optional when only have 1 parameter...
parameter => { statements }
//and written as () when have 0
() { statements }
// If returning an expression, remove the brackets
parameters => expression
// which is equivalent to:
function (params) {
  return expression;
}
```

Why use arrow functions?

* Shorter syntax
* `this` is lexically bound (keeps its meaning from its original context)
